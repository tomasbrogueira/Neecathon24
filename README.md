**This project was done in the context of a 30 hour hackathon (NEECATHON 2025).**


The project consists of a computer vision model applied to a live video feed to detect sleepiness, as well as communication with a microcontroller.

The datasets used for training the computer vision models are in the neecathon24-datasets repository, which is private for privacy purposes. These datasets consist of the MRL eye dataset and a custom dataset created during the competition, made up of 150 pictures of different people present in the competition itself.
